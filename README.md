## Angular Webpack Boilerplate

Due to how unwieldy I often found the Angular-cli to be, I decided to make this webpack-boilerplate. Note that my main source for building this config file is the official documentation's [webpack page](https://angular.io/guide/webpack).

Though will reflect my preferences, it'll be easy enough to modify and extend.

Just copy the dependencies and dev-dependencies into your package.json file, and then copy over the other files. 

Ideally, you could just clone this repo into your project before commencing it, (re)initialze a git repo with `git init` and initialize the node project with `yarn init` or `npm init`

**CURRENT STATUS: NEARING FIRST RELEASE**
