## Angular Webpack Boilerplate

Due to how unwieldy I often found the Angular-cli to be, I decided to make this webpack-boilerplate. Note that my main source for building this config file is the official documentation's [webpack page](https://angular.io/guide/webpack).

Though will reflect my preferences, it'll be easy enough to modify and extend.

**CURRENT STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS**
